# MPP revenue to Peer Cash

A merchant server that accepts Base USDC over MPP, counts successful settlements, and prepares
an unsigned Peer Cash plan once confirmed revenue reaches a threshold.

The public MPP route and the cash-out planner are separate listeners. The planner binds to
`127.0.0.1` and never accepts private keys, signs, or broadcasts. The merchant wallet that receives
the MPP revenue keeps custody and decides whether to submit the returned transactions.

This example was first proposed to mppx in
[wevm/mppx#798](https://github.com/wevm/mppx/pull/798). Its maintainer confirmed that the Base
payment flow was sound and asked that the vendor-specific cash-out example live in Peer-owned
source or documentation.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zkp2p/peer-cash.git
cd peer-cash/examples/mpp-revenue-cashout
bun install

export MPPX_RECIPIENT=0xMerchantWallet
export X402_FACILITATOR_URL=https://your-facilitator.example
export MPP_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-at-least-32-random-characters
export PEER_CASH_PLATFORM=revolut
export PEER_CASH_CURRENCY=USD
export PEER_CASH_PAYEE=your-handle
export PEER_CASH_THRESHOLD_USDC=10

bun run dev
```

Use a facilitator that supports Base mainnet USDC. The recipient must be the merchant-controlled
Base wallet that will sign any Peer Cash transactions.

## Payment and cash-out flow

Pay the MPP resource with an EVM-capable client:

```bash
MPPX_PRIVATE_KEY=0x... bunx mppx http://localhost:5173/api/report
```

Inspect confirmed, unreserved revenue on the local admin listener:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5174/status
```

After the threshold is reached, prepare a cash-out for all available revenue:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5174/cashout \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{}'
```

Pass `{"amountUsdc":"5.25"}` to prepare a smaller amount. The response contains unsigned
transactions and same-index step descriptions. Review them, then sign and submit them with the
recipient wallet.

The example deduplicates successful MPP receipts and reserves planned amounts in memory so a
second request cannot prepare the same revenue again. A production service must persist settlement,
reservation, transaction, and deposit state before exposing an equivalent operator endpoint.
