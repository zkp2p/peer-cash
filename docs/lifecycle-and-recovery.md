# Lifecycle and recovery

The one deep guide: what states exist, how partial fills work, why there is no
ETA, how unwinding works, and why every order survives a crash.

## The model: you are the maker

A Peer Cash order is a **deposit** in the ZKP2P EscrowV2 contract. When you
`cashout()`, your USDC moves into escrow at the live Chainlink oracle rate
with zero spread. A buyer (a standard protocol taker) _signals an intent_
against your deposit, pays you fiat off-chain (Venmo, Revolut, Wise, …), and
proves the payment via TEE-TLS. The escrow then releases your USDC to them.
The protocol runs in its normal direction — nothing here is inverted or
special-cased.

Because your deposit is priced at market with no spread, it is the best offer
on the book by construction. That is the fill incentive.

## States

Every state derives from on-chain events. There are no synthetic states.

| State            | On-chain meaning                                    | `nextActions`                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `awaiting-buyer` | Deposit live, no active intent                      | `['wait', 'withdraw']`                                        |
| `matched`        | A buyer signaled; funds locked                      | `['wait']` (or `['wait','withdraw']` once the intent expires) |
| `delivering`     | Partial fill in progress: some delivered, more live | `['wait']` / `['wait','withdraw']`                            |
| `delivered`      | Fully paid and proven; escrow released              | `[]`                                                          |
| `returned`       | Funds back in your wallet (withdrawn)               | `[]`                                                          |

Intent statuses underneath: `SIGNALED → FULFILLED` (paid + proven),
`PRUNED` (expired unpaid), `MANUALLY_RELEASED` (support path, counts as
fulfilled). Always query the full set — the indexer defaults to `SIGNALED`
only, which silently hides terminal states.

## Partial fills

A 1,000 USDC order does not need one 1,000 USDC buyer. The deposit accepts
intents between `intentAmountRange.min` (default 1 USDC) and the full amount.
Three buyers can take 400 + 350 + 250. The order shows each as a `fill` and
passes through `delivering` until the last one completes. `filledAmount`,
`pendingAmount`, and `totalAmount` always add up against the chain.

## The honest-ETA principle

`order.explain()` returns one sentence built from live data. It will never
show a countdown, a progress percentage, or an "estimated arrival" — because
none of those are knowable:

- **Buyer arrival time is market-driven.** A deposit at market rate should
  fill fast, but "should" is not a number we can print.
- **The binding rate resolves at fill time.** `estimate()` reads the same
  Chainlink feed the escrow will read, but between estimate and fill the
  market moves. `kind: 'oracle-estimate'` is the API telling you this.

Anything that looks like a committed quote or a delivery timer in a UI built
on this SDK is a bug in that UI.

## Managing a live order

- **Top up** — `topUp(depositId, amount)` adds USDC to a live order: same
  payee, same market-rate pricing, no new registration. Closed orders reject
  with `ORDER_NOT_ACTIVE`; start a new `cashout()` instead.
- **Partial withdrawal** — `withdraw(depositId, { amount })` pulls part of
  the _unlocked_ balance back out. A live buyer intent does not block it
  (their locked portion is untouched); asking for more than the unlocked
  balance fails with `INSUFFICIENT_AVAILABLE_FUNDS`.
- There is no retain-on-empty or rate knob to manage — a cash order cleans
  itself up when fully filled, and the market rate is not configurable.

## Receipts, decoded

Everything an order serves is decoded to human units: platform ids and
currency codes instead of bytes32 hashes, plain-number rates instead of 1e18
bigints (raw values stay available as `*Hash` / `conversionRate` fields).

Each fill is a receipt that sharpens over its life:

- **At signal**: `rate` (the oracle rate locked for THIS fill — the moment
  "approximately" becomes exact) and `fiatOwed` (`amount × rate`, rounded up
  to the cent, matching what the buyer's client tells them to pay).
- **After the proof**: `fiatPaid` (the verified amount actually sent),
  `paidCurrency`, `paymentId` (the platform's own payment reference),
  `paidAt`, `releasedAmount` (USDC actually released), and
  `fillLatencySeconds` (signal → proven delivery).

Orders also carry their `payouts` legs reconstructed from the chain —
platform, currency, payee hash, and a pricing proof (`spreadBps: 0`,
`kind: 'oracle_chainlink'`, `marketRate: true`): the zero-spread claim is a
queryable fact, not marketing copy.

## Who is this buyer?

`buyer(address)` aggregates the matched buyer's full intent history into a
track record: lifetime intents, fulfilled vs pruned counts, a success rate in
basis points, first/last seen. Use it during `matched` — the moment a
stranger's address is holding your order is exactly when a 95%-success,
200-order counterparty reads very differently from a fresh wallet.

## Unwinding: one verb

`withdraw(depositId, { signer })` handles every recovery case:

1. **No buyer yet** (`awaiting-buyer`): withdraws directly. Funds return in
   one transaction.
2. **Buyer signaled but never paid**: their intent expires on-chain. The
   escrow still counts it as active, so `withdraw()` first sends
   `pruneExpiredIntents`, then withdraws. Two transactions, one call.
3. **Buyer is actively paying** (live intent): withdrawal would strand the
   buyer, so the escrow blocks it and the SDK throws
   `ACTIVE_INTENT_BLOCKS_WITHDRAWAL` (`retryable: true`). Wait for delivery
   or expiry, then call `withdraw()` again.
4. **Nothing left** (`delivered`/`returned`): throws `NOTHING_TO_WITHDRAW`.

There is deliberately no `cancel` vs `recover` split — the deposit state
decides, not the caller. Agents needing host-side signing use
`prepareWithdraw(depositId)` for the same logic as unsigned `txs[]`.

## Resumability

The `depositId` (composite `escrow_onchainId`) is the only key you need:

- `cashout()` returns it, parsed from the `DepositReceived` event in the
  transaction receipt — available immediately, no indexer wait.
- `order(depositId)` reconstructs the full order from the indexer at any
  time, on any machine. There is no session, no cache, no local store.
- Bind orders to your own users with one column in **your** database:
  `userId → depositId`.

## Indexer lag

Right after `cashout()`, the indexer may not have seen the deposit yet
(typically a few seconds). `order()` throws `ORDER_NOT_FOUND` with
`retryable: true`; `watch()` and the React hooks absorb this and keep
polling. Do not treat an immediate `ORDER_NOT_FOUND` as a lost deposit — the
transaction receipt you already hold is the source of truth.
